# PWA_Game
Our task is to program a game in the form of a PWA (Progressive Web App), where movement on the screen will be controlled by tilting the mobile device, using a mouse, or by pressing keys on the keyboard (arrow keys or W, A, S, D keys). It is expected that all three alternatives (mobile tilt, mouse, keyboard) will be implemented.

The game will be playable on both desktop and mobile. If played on mobile, the built-in gyroscope should be used. For the desktop version, the mouse and keyboard will be used. During gameplay, only vertical and horizontal movement should be utilized, i.e., clicking the mouse should not be used.
